Create a markdown table from a Spotify album or playlist link
Make sure you have the ```spotipy``` package installed (via pip is fine)
Create a Spotify Developer account (https://developer.spotify.com), create a new application, put name/description as whatever, set redirect URI to https://localhost:8888/callback
Then you can get a Client ID and Client Secret and put them on lines 11 and 12 in spotify_table.py
